/* This is an example of the escape hatch for emotion CSS-in-JS.
 * Ideally you want to avoid using this as much as possible, and use the
 * ThemeProvider styling provided by emotion-theming.
 *
 * However, there *are* cases where vanilla CSS is more appropriate
 * so this is still provided as a fallback.
 *
 * Or, if you're plain uncomfortable with CSS-in-JS, emotion can be ignored entirely (and
 * all styling done through vanilla CSS as provided through webpack's css-loader)
